# Disable Free Saves

*Version from 2017-01-21 for UrqW 1.0.*

A plugin for [UrqW](https://github.com/urqw/UrqW) that disables free saves.

This plugin disables saving via the toolbar button with the image of a floppy disk ("Save game") and hides it. However, autosaves initiated from the game code using the `save` operator continue to work.

If you also want to hide the Load game button, uncomment the corresponding line in the script.js file.

The plugin and an example of its use can be found in the urqw directory. A demo of the plugin can be viewed at <https://urqw.github.io/UrqW#disable_free_saves>

For other UrqW plugins, see the [common repository](https://github.com/urqw/plugins).

Be careful, though: not all UrqW plugins can be easily combined.
